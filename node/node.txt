Node.js vs. JavaScript
Node.js and JavaScript are closely related but not the same. Here's a breakdown:

JavaScript
What It Is: A programming language primarily used for creating interactive features on websites.
Where It Runs: Traditionally runs in the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) through a JavaScript engine like V8 (Chrome).
Purpose: Frontend development, manipulating the DOM, handling user interactions, etc.
Environment: Limited to browser APIs like window, document, etc.
Node.js
What It Is: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
Where It Runs: Runs on the server using the V8 JavaScript engine.
Purpose: Backend development, handling server-side logic, file systems, databases, APIs, etc.
Environment: Provides additional features like fs (file system), http (server creation), etc., which aren't available in browsers.
Key Differences
Feature	JavaScript (Browser)	Node.js
Environment	Runs in browsers (frontend)	Runs on servers (backend)
APIs Available	Browser-specific APIs (DOM, fetch)	Server-side APIs (fs, http)
Modules	Uses ES Modules (import/export)	Supports CommonJS (require) and ES6
Use Case	Client-side scripting	Server-side scripting, API creation
File Access	No access to file system	Full access to file system
How Are They Related?
Same Language: Node.js uses JavaScript as its programming language.
Different Contexts: JavaScript in browsers is focused on user interaction, while Node.js is used for backend/server tasks.
Shared Syntax: They share the same syntax, but the APIs and features available differ based on the environment.
Analogy
Think of JavaScript as a musician and Node.js as the stage. The musician (JavaScript) can perform in different venues (browser or Node.js), but the tools and audience differ based on the venue.

When to Use What?
Frontend Development: Use JavaScript in browsers (e.g., with React, Vue, or vanilla JS).
Backend Development: Use Node.js to build server-side logic (e.g., with Express, Nest.js).
